    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: {{ now()->toFormattedDateString() }}</p>

    <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This App connects users who wish to <strong>buy or sell products</strong>, especially <strong>property, cars, bikes, and used items</strong>. The platform does not support in-app purchases or online payments — it is a connection-based system where users can contact each other via chat or call.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Token:</strong> We collect your device’s notification token to send push notifications (e.g., new messages, promotional alerts).</li>
        <li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> If you create an account, we may store your name, email address, and profile details to identify you on the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Listings:</strong> We store the items you list for sale, including category, description, and images.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> We store messages exchanged between users to ensure a smooth experience and handle abuse reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>This app only requests permission for <strong>push notifications</strong>. We do not access your location, camera, contacts, or microphone unless explicitly required for future updates (with consent).</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To enable communication between buyers and sellers</li>
        <li>To send important alerts (new messages, updates, or promotions)</li>
        <li>To improve app functionality and troubleshoot issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services like Firebase for notifications and backend operations. These services may collect limited technical data as per their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. Your data is only visible to other users as required to use the app (e.g., name, listing details, chat).</p>

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>We encourage users to communicate respectfully and verify details before making any purchase/sale decisions. Our platform only facilitates connections — we are not liable for transactions or disputes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard measures to protect your data, but no system is 100% secure. Use the app responsibly and report any suspicious activity.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at <strong>support@big-brain.co.in</strong>.</p>

    <p>By using our app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
