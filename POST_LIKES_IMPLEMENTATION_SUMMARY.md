## üîÑ Key Changes from Post Followers to Post Likes

### 1. Unified Like System

- **Before:** Separate follow and like systems
- **After:** Single like system that replaces follows
- **Benefit:** Simpler user experience, clearer intent

### 2. API Consistency

- **Before:** `/follow-post` for follows, separate like endpoints
- **After:** `/follow-post` for likes (same endpoint, different functionality)
- **Benefit:** Maintains API compatibility while changing behavior

### 3. Database Simplification

- **Before:** `post_followers` table with `post_user_id` field
- **After:** `post_likes` table with just `user_id` and `post_id`
- **Benefit:** Cleaner schema, easier to understand

### 4. Frontend Simplification

- **Before:** Multiple hooks for different interactions
- **After:** Single hook handles all like functionality
- **Benefit:** Less code duplication, easier maintenance

## üöÄ Migration Process

### For Existing Data:

1. **Run Migrations:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

   This will:

   - Add view_count and like_count to posts
   - Create post_views and post_likes tables
   - Drop post_followers table

2. **Data Migration:**
   - Existing post_followers data is lost (as requested)
   - Users will need to re-like posts they previously followed
   - This is intentional for a clean slate

### For New Installations:

- All tables created fresh with new structure
- No migration needed

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

4. **Clearer Intent:** Like is more intuitive than follow for posts
